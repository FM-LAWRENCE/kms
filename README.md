  '‚Ç¶' + FORMAT(SUM(Sales), 'N2') AS [Total Sales (‚Ç¶)]
FROM 
  orders_data
GROUP BY 
  Customer_Name
ORDER BY 
  SUM(Sales) DESC;
```

| 5    | Grant Carroll         | ‚Ç¶88,417.00       |

```sql
-- Products they buy:
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS purchase_count
FROM orders_data
WHERE customer_name = 'Emily Phan' -- Replace with actual top customer
GROUP BY category;
```
**Result**: Top customers tend to purchase *Technology* and *Office Supplies*.

---

### 8. **Small business customer with highest sales**
